### GENERAL PIPELINE PARAMETERS
#####-----------------------------------------

# Whether to perform additional processing of BAM files prior to transcript assembly with StringTie
# Put "none" for now. Other options possibly added in future...
pre_stringtie_processing: "none"

###
# Reference GTF filtering
###

# True / False to switch on/off reference filtering
filter_ref_gtf: True

# Specify which GTF entries to retain based on attribute keys & values
# LHS key - name of attribute in GTF (this can vary between Gencode/Ensembl so double check)
# e.g. gene_type in Gencode vs gene_biotype in Ensembl GTF
ref_gtf_include_flags:
    # put empty list [] if no filtering
    gene_type: ["protein_coding", "lncRNA"]

ref_gtf_exclude_flags:
    # Leave empty for now...


# Minimum transcript support level for tx to be retained
# Put 'None' (no quotes) for no TSL filtering
min_transcript_support_level: 3

# 'tag' attribute - which tags should be included/excluded?
include_tags: []
exclude_tags: ["mRNA_end_NF"]

###
# Expression filtering
###

# Minimum mean TPM value across samples of the same condition for an assembled transcript to be retained
# Proposed to considerably improve transcript accuracy (Bioxriv pre-print from Swamy et al.; 2020)
# Default: 1
min_mean_tpm: 1

###
# Splice junction matching/filtering
###

# Tolerance window (nt) to match 5'ends of reference first exons & first exon extension events
# Predicted 5'ends can be inprecise relative to annotation, this gives some leeway in matching these events
first_exon_5p_tolerance: 100

# Tolerance window (nt) to match 5'ends of reference exons & overlapping putative last exon
other_exon_5p_tolerance: 0


# when filtering assembled transcripts, valid should have intron chain match up until penultimate intron(s)
# 'transcript' - NOT YET IMPLEMENTED - introns/splice junctions come from the same transcript
# 'any' - matching introns/splice junctions can come from any transcript
intron_chain_filter_mode: "any"

# Max number of consective 3'end non-matched introns for a transcript to be considered valid
# Default: 2 (equivalent to allowing the penultimate exon of transcript to also be novel)
max_terminal_non_match: 2

# Minimum length of 3'end extension for novel 3'UTR extension events to be retained
# Applied to 'internal_exon_bleedthrough' & 'ds_3utr_extension' events
# Default: 100
min_extension_length: 100

# Number of threads/cpus for scripts/filter_tx_by_intron_chain.py
# Default: 1
intron_chain_filter_threads: 1

###
# 3'end transcript filtering
###

# Maximum distance between predicted 3'end and nearest polya_site_atlas site for a transcript to be retained
max_atlas_distance: 100

# Length of region from 3'end (to upstream) to search for presence of polyA signal motifs
motif_search_region_length: 100

# Expected distance upstream from 3'end for polyA signal motifs (typically enriched ~20nt upstream
# from cleavage site). If a last exon has multiple found motifs, the 3'end with a motif closest to
# this value will be selected as the representative 3'end.
motif_expected_distance: 20

# Which poly(A) signal motifs to use to retain 3'ends with evidence of genuine cleavage event
# 'Gruber' - 18 conserved motifs (mouse and human) identified by Gruber et al., 2016
# 'Beaudoing' - 12 conserved motifs identified by Beaudoing 2000 (all of which also identified by Gruber 2016)
# Path to TXT file of custom (DNA) PAS motifs, one per-line
polya_signal_motifs: "Gruber"


###
# Summarising polyA site expression
###

# How to summarise transcript abundance to polyA site isoforms for each gene
# 'polyA' - sum expression of transcripts if they share a poly(A) site
# 'last_exon' - sum expression if they share a last exon (any overlap). 3'UTR extension events will be considered as separate last exons
expression_merge_by: "last_exon"

# Target window size (nt) for merging closely spaced polyA sites to a single polyA cluster
# Window is centred on 3'end of each transcripts -
# PyRanges considers polyA sites as 1nt length intervals
# pas_merge_window_size - 1 is extended EITHER direction of each polyA site
pas_merge_window_size: 25
